Group 5 Data Processing and Visualisation Group Task
---
As a group we have made this program to provide insights into a USA housing dataset through data processing and visualisations.
---
To run the program:
1.Download the file Main.py and USA Housing Dataset.csv and open in Visual Studio Code.

2.Make sure you have the Pandas, Matplotlib and Pgeodo libraries installed.

3.To install the libraries if you have not already run: 
pip install matplotlib 
pip install pandas 
pip install pgeocode

4.Run the Main.py file. You will be presented with a main menu and from there you can navigate through the program.
    When you run the code you will be greeted by a main menu giving you 5 choices you should input the number at the start of the line for the option you wish to select with no additinal keys entered which will then call the function required

    Choosing print dataset should print the entire database at once for free viewing.

    if you selected questions you should be met by a similar menu and should repeat the previous step to select the option you want which should print text and when you are done press 5 to go back to main menu

    if you selected visualisation it is the same as the steps above to select a user and then to select their individual visualisations which should then display a generated graph based on what option was selected.
