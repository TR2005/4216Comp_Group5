As a group we have made this program to provide insights into a USA housing dataset through data processing and visualisations.
---
To run the program:
1.Download the file Main.py and USA Housing Dataset.csv and open in Visual Studio Code.

2.Make sure you have the Pandas, Matplotlib and Pgeodo libraries installed.

3.To install the libraries if you have not already run:
pip install matplotlib 
pip install pandas
pip install pgeocode

4.Run the Main.py file. You will be presented with a main menu and from there you can navigate through the program.

To find the main visualisations, press 2 on the main menu and then select the team member whose visualisations you would like to see.
